          <p>
            Last summer in Taipei, I spent two weeks eating my way through night markets. Somewhere between
            my third scallion pancake and a bowl of beef noodle soup that changed my understanding of broth,
            I realized I was witnessing something that has nothing and everything to do with software.
          </p>

          <p>
            The best street food vendors have perfected the thing most tech companies spend millions trying
            to achieve: a frictionless, delightful experience that keeps people coming back. And they do it
            with a folding table and a propane stove.
          </p>

          <h2>Lesson 1: Reduce the Menu</h2>

          <p>
            The stalls that had the longest lines typically sold one or two things. Not because they couldn't
            cook more, but because focus is a feature. When you only make one dish, every repetition makes
            it better. You notice the small things: the exact second to flip the wrapper, the ratio of
            filling to dough that makes the texture perfect.
          </p>

          <p>
            The parallel to product design is obvious. The apps I love most do fewer things but do them
            extraordinarily well. Scope is the enemy of craft.
          </p>

          <h2>Lesson 2: Speed Is a Feature</h2>

          <p>
            A good street food vendor serves you in under two minutes. The workflow is choreographed.
            Ingredients are pre-portioned. Steps happen in parallel. There's no wasted motion.
          </p>

          <p>
            When we talk about UX, we often focus on visual design and information architecture. But speed
            is the most underrated UX feature. Every millisecond of loading time is friction. Every
            unnecessary click is a reason to leave.
          </p>

          <h2>Lesson 3: Trust the Regular</h2>

          <p>
            The real signal of quality isn't the tourist crowd. It's the regular who shows up every morning
            at the same stall, orders the same thing with a nod, and sits in the same spot. That person
            has tried every stall on the street and this is the one they come back to.
          </p>

          <p>
            Retention is the metric that matters. Not downloads, not sign-ups, not page views. The question
            is whether someone comes back tomorrow without being reminded.
          </p>
