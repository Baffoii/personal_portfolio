            There is a particular kind of satisfaction that comes from using software that just works. Not software
            that dazzles you with animations or overwhelms you with features, but the kind that quietly does its
            job, year after year, without demanding your attention.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of the tools I rely on daily are like this. They were built years ago by people who cared more
            about reliability than novelty. They don't have landing pages with gradient backgrounds or investor
            decks. They just work.
          </p>

          <h2>The Case for Boring Technology</h2>

          <p>
            There's a well-known essay that argues for choosing boring technology. The idea is straightforward:
            every new technology you introduce carries a cost. That cost isn't just learning curves or
            documentation gaps. It's the unknown unknowns, the failure modes you haven't encountered yet,
            the edge cases that only reveal themselves under pressure.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you choose a boring, proven technology, you're choosing predictability. You're choosing to spend
            your innovation budget on the things that actually matter to your users rather than on the infrastructure
            underneath.
          </p>

          <h2>What Durability Requires</h2>

          <p>
            Building something that lasts requires a different mindset than building something that ships fast.
            It requires thinking about the person who will maintain this code in three years and might not be you.
            It requires resisting the urge to optimize for the demo and instead optimizing for the mundane
            Tuesday afternoon when something breaks.
          </p>

          <p>
            This doesn't mean being conservative for its own sake. It means being intentional about where you
            spend complexity. Every layer of abstraction, every dependency, every clever trick is a liability
            that future you will have to understand, debug, and potentially replace.
          </p>

          <h2>The Long Game</h2>

          <p>
            I've started thinking about my own projects through this lens. Not every project needs to last forever,
            and not every hack needs to be refactored. But for the tools I want to use for years, I've found
            that a little upfront discipline goes a long way. Write clear commit messages. Choose dependencies
            carefully. Document the decisions that aren't obvious from the code.
          </p>

          <p>
            The best code I've written isn't the cleverest. It's the code that someone else could read and
            understand without asking me a single question. That's what durability looks like.
          </p>
